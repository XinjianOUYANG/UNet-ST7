# ST7 project: U-Net for tumor segmentation

This is the evaluation project for ST7 course.

**[Practical_Session_U-Nets.ipynb](https://github.com/XinjianOUYANG/UNet-ST7/blob/master/Pratical_Session_U_Nets.ipynb) is the introduction of our practical work.**

**run *main.py* to load our model and test it (testing results are saved in folder *evaluation*)**

## OverView

Folder *weight* saves the model we have trained, and the model is saved in h5 format.

Folder *train* is our dataset whose pictures are labelled in folder *label*

Folder *evaluation* is the dataset used for testing models.

u_net.py builds a U-net and tests it.
